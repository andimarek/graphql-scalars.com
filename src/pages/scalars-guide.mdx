# Coercion functions

The fundamental job of a Scalar is to give type safety about the values which are returned or which can be used as input.

This type safety is implemented through three functions per Scalar. Each function is invoked at a specific time by the GraphQL engine. 
They all validate and convert a provided value. This conversion is called "Coercion" in GraphQL. 

Overview of the coercion functions:

## Result Coercion 

Result Coercion takes the result of a resolver and converts it into an appropriate value for the result.

This result value is NOT the seralized value. Serialization is an extra step.

## Literal Coercion 

Literal Coercion takes an abstract syntax tree (Ast) element from a schema definition or query and converts it into an appropriate 
argument value for a resolver.

## Value Coercion 

Value Coercion take runtime values (which come from variables) and conv

# Language specific guide

## GraphQL.js

In GraphQL.js the functions corresponding to the coercion functions are:


| Coercion Function | GraphQL.js
| ------------- |-------------
| Result Coercion | `serialize`
| Literal Coercion | `parseLiteral`
| Value Coercion | `parseValue`

## GraphQL Java

In GraphQL Java the functions corresponding to the coercion functions are defined in the [Coercing Interface](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/blob/master/src/main/java/graphql/schema/Coercing.java) :

| Coercion Function | GraphQL Java
| ------------- |-------------
| Result Coercion | `serialize`
| Literal Coercion | `parseLiteral`
| Value Coercion | `parseValue`
