<h1>DateTime Scalar spec</h1>

```toc
# This code block gets replaced with the TOC
```

Specification for a custom GraphQL Scalar which represents an exact point in time. This point in time is specified by having an offset to UTC and does not use time zone.  

# Based on RFC 3339

This Scalar is a slightly refined version of [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) including the [errata](https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/rfc3339).

All definitions of RFC 3339 are adopted and nothing is added or removed unless explicitly mentioned here.

The following refinements/clarifications apply:

##  Only "date-time"

This scalar represents a “date-time” as specified in [section 5.6 of RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6). 

The other productions in section 5.6 are only used to support "date-time" but never stand alone for this Scalar. 


## Non optional exact milliseconds

RFC 3339 defines `time-secfrac` optional as: 

```
time-secfrac    = "." 1*DIGIT (Meaning 1 or more DIGIT)
```

This allows for an unlimited numbers of digits. For this scalar the rule is not optional anymore and
refined as:

```
time-secfrac    = "." DIGIT DIGIT DIGIT
```

consisting always of exact three digits representing milliseconds.


## No 'Unknown Local Offset Convention'

[Section 4.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-4.3) says: 

```
If the time in UTC is known, but the offset to local time is unknown, 
this can be represented with an offset of "-00:00".
```

In order to simplify this Scalar this convention is dropped and an offset of `-00:00` is not allowed.


# Result Coercion

## Input

The accepted values are implementation specific, but it is recommend to accept Strings and other types representing Dates. 

## Output

The outcome of the result Coercion should always be a String formatted as "date-time" as described above.

UTC offset should be formatted as `Z` and not `+00:00` and lower case `z` and `t` should be converted to `Z` and `T`.

# Literal Coercion

## Input

Only String literals are accepted formatted as "date-time" as described above. 

## Output

The output value is implementation specific, but the value should accurately capture a "date-time" as described above. It is especially discouraged to use  a value with a time zone instead of an offset, because time zone to offset conversion is non trivial.   

# Value Coercion

## Input

The specific values for the input are implementation specific, but they should be semantically equivalent to "date-time" without any conversion.
It is especially discouraged to accept values with time zones instead of offsets, because the conversion from time zone to offset is non trivial. 

## Output

Implementation specific.


# Test cases


These are valid Strings accepted for the input of Literal Coercion: 

| String        | Explanation 
| ------------- |-------------
| `2011-08-30T13:22:53.108Z` | A DateTime with UTC offset (+00:00).
| `2011-08-30T13:22:53.108+00:00` | A DateTime with `+00:00` which is the same as UTC.
| `2011-08-30t13:22:53.108z` |  The `z` and `t` may be lower case.
| `2011-08-30T13:22:53.108-03:00` | A DateTime with -3h offset.
| `2011-08-30T13:22:53.108+03:30` | A DateTime with +3h 30min offset.

These are invalid Strings which should be rejected as Literal Coercion Input and should not 
be an output of Result Coercion:


| String        | Why is it invalid 
| ------------- |-------------
| `2011-08-30T13:22:53.108-03` | The minutes of the offset are missing.
| `2011-08-30T13:22:53.108912Z` | Too many digits for fractions of a second. Exactly three expected.
| `2011-08-30T24:22:53Z` | Fractions of a second are missing.
| `2011-08-30T13:22:53.108` | No offset provided.
| `2011-08-30` | No time provided.
| `2011-08-30T13:22:53.108-00:00` | Negative offset (`-00:00`) is not allowed
| `2011-08-30T13:22:53.108+03:30:15` | Seconds are not allowed for the offset
| `2011-08-30T24:22:53.108Z` | `24` is not allowed as hour of the time.
| `2010-02-30T21:22:53.108Z` | 30th of February is not a valid date
| `2010-02-11T21:22:53.108Z+25:11` | 25 is not a valid hour for offset


# Recommended Scalar name

The obvious recommended name for the Scalar is `DateTime`.
If this name is not available then one alternative is `OffsetDateTime`, which describes the Scalar quite accurately.
